Platterman docs
===================================

**Platterman** is a platformer made using Python and Pygame with
tiles set out in a 32x32 grid. The main draw of the game is how varied
the tiles can be and how unique the gameplay can become with tile combinations

Check out the :doc:`tiles` section for information about existing tiles,
and the :doc:`modding` section for how you can add your own. Mechanics (like
the lighting system) and their uses in-game are detailed in :doc:`gameplay`.
